# How Tournament Payouts Are Calculated (Plain English Explanation)

This guide explains how we determine the prize amounts for tournament winners. It’s designed to be easy to understand, even if you’re not a tech expert.

## 1. Building the Prize Pool

- **Total Money Collected:**  
  Every participant pays an entry fee. The total money collected (or "pot") is simply the number of players multiplied by the entry fee.

- **Platform Fee and Prize Pool:**  
  From this total pot, 10% is taken as a fee by the platform. The remaining 90% becomes the prize pool – this is the money that will be given out as prizes.

## 2. Deciding Who Wins

- **Top 25% Rule:**  
  Only the top 25% of the entrants will win a prize. For example, if 100 people enter, the top 25 players will get something.

## 3. Splitting Up the Prize Pool

Depending on how many winners there are, we split the prize pool into different portions:

### For Smaller Tournaments (When There Are 10 or Fewer Winners):

- We use a list of percentages (like 25%, 15%, 10%, etc.) that are meant for 10 spots.
- Since there might be fewer than 10 winners, we adjust these percentages so that all the prize money is fairly distributed among the winners.

### For Larger Tournaments (More Than 10 Winners):

- **Top 5 Winners:**

  - 1st place gets 25% of the prize pool.
  - 2nd place gets 15%.
  - 3rd place gets 10%.
  - 4th place gets 7%.
  - 5th place gets 5%.

- **Winners Ranked 6th to 10th:**  
  Each of these positions receives 4% of the prize pool.

- **Winners Ranked 11th and Beyond:**  
  In our plan, if there were exactly 25 winners, the remaining 15 winners (from 11th to 25th) would share 18% of the prize pool. This means each would normally get about 1.2%.

## 4. Keeping It Fair for Everyone

Sometimes the tournament doesn’t have as many winners as originally planned. For example, if only 13 people win instead of 25, here’s what can happen:

- **Problem:**  
  If we just split the full 18% among fewer players, each of these lower-ranked winners (like the one in 11th place) might end up with more money than someone in 10th place, which wouldn’t seem fair.

- **Solution:**  
  To keep the order fair, we adjust the share for the lower-ranked winners when there aren’t as many as expected. Instead of giving them a bigger share when there are fewer players, we limit it so that each winner from 11th onward still gets the same small portion (around 1.2%). This way, the prize for 10th place (4%) always stays higher than that for 11th place.

## 5. In Summary

- **Total Pot:** Money from all entry fees.
- **Prize Pool:** 90% of the total pot (after deducting a 10% fee).
- **Winners:** The top 25% of players.
- **Payouts:**
  - For small tournaments, we adjust a preset list of percentages to fit the number of winners.
  - For larger tournaments, we use fixed percentages for the top 10 positions and a planned share for lower positions.
- **Fairness:**  
  If there aren’t enough winners in the lower positions, we scale down their shares to ensure no one in a lower spot (like 11th) ends up getting more than someone in a higher spot (like 10th).

This method ensures that the distribution is fair, transparent, and adapts to both small and large tournaments.
